# Code comprehension

Remember to **preview a markdown file** on your computer you can do:
Ctrl + Shift + V (Windows/Linux) or CMD + Shift + V (Mac)

Consider the code in this program below:

```js
function calculateSum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

function logSum(a, b) {
  console.log(a + b);
}

const result1 = calculateSum(10, 32);
const result2 = logSum(10, 32);
```

a) what will `result1` evaluate to? Explain your answer


b) What will `result2` evaluate to? Explain your answer

c) Try to summarise the main difference between `logSum` and `calculateSum`



{YOUR ANSWERS HERE}
a. result1 is 42 because calculate sum adds the 2 arguments together and returns the answer.

b.result2 will give us undefined because the function does not return anything.

c. calculatesum is returning the actual sum of the 2 numbers and logsum displays the sum of the 2 numbers but does not return anything

d. trying branch
